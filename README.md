# Project Proposal: Noise Robustness Testing for Data-Driven Feature Tracking in Event Cameras

## Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate and enhance the robustness of a data-driven feature tracking model for event cameras by simulating real-world noise. This will be achieved by introducing noise and transformations to event data, implementing a noise-tolerant loss function, and rigorously testing the model's stability under noisy conditions.

## Goals
1. To simulate real-world variations by applying affine transformations and noise to event data.
2. To incorporate a truncated loss function to manage errors induced by noise during model training.
3. To evaluate model performance with metrics that capture feature tracking stability, especially under different levels of noise.

## Dataset
- **Event Camera Dataset (EC):** Includes both events and frames, providing ground truth camera poses and suitable for initial testing.
- **Event-aided Direct Sparse Odometry (EDS) Dataset:** Contains higher resolution event data and challenging scenarios that will help assess noise robustness.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation and Noise Simulation**
   - Acquire the EC and EDS datasets, and preprocess for model compatibility.
   - Introduce varying degrees of noise into event streams, simulating real-world conditions (e.g., Gaussian noise).
   - Apply affine transformations, including random rotations, translations, and scalings, to introduce additional variability.

2. **Model Training with Noise Robustness Techniques**
   - Train the baseline feature tracking model on augmented data.
   - Implement a truncated loss function that disregards large errors, effectively limiting noise impact on training.
   - Fine-tune the model using noise-augmented data to optimize for noise robustness.

3. **Evaluation Strategy**
   - Measure tracking performance using **Feature Age** (duration a feature can be reliably tracked) and **Expected Feature Age** (tracks stable across varying conditions).
   - Test the model under increasing noise levels and evaluate performance at each level to establish robustness thresholds.
   - Compare results with a baseline model without noise robustness features to demonstrate improvement.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Feature Age**: Measures how long the model can reliably track features in a noisy environment.
- **Expected Feature Age**: Evaluates overall stability, factoring in the percentage of features that remain stable under noisy conditions.
- **Error Tolerance Metrics**: Track error rates under varying noise conditions to quantify improvements from the truncated loss function.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Augmented Event Dataset**: Including noise variations and transformations for reproducible testing.
2. **Trained Model**: A noise-robust feature tracking model for event cameras.
3. **Evaluation Report**: Detailed report on feature age and expected feature age across noise levels, comparing baseline and noise-robust models.
4. **Code Documentation**: Documented code for noise augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch for model development, OpenCV for affine transformations and augmentation
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX 3080 or above) for efficient model training
- **Libraries**: SciPy and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and DVS tools for event camera data handling
